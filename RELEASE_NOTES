 DDF Library
-----------------------------

The Distributed DataFrame Library (DDF Library) provides distributed algorithms and operations ready to use as a
library implemented over PyCOMPSs programming model.

Release number: 0.4
Release date: September-2019
-------------------------------
New features:

 - Besides the generation of DAG provided by COMPSs at the level of tasks, it is now possible to generate a DAG by
 DDF at the level of submitted operations;
 - COMPSsContext is capable of analyzing the current workflow to remove some obsolete data (serialized data) and
 to recompute if needed in the future;


Improvements:

 - Some algorithms and operations were improved, for instance, operations like join, sort, and aggregation use a
 re-partitioning approach to reduce the number of tasks;
