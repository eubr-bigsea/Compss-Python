        Metric	Definition
        * Mean Squared Error (MSE): Is an estimator measures the average of the
        squares of the errors or deviationsâ€”that is, the difference between the
        estimator and what is estimated. MSE is a risk function, corresponding
        to the expected value of the squared error loss or quadratic loss. In
        other words, MSE tells you how close a regression line is to a set of
        points.

        * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Is a frequently used measure of the
        differences between values (sample and population values) predicted by a
        model or an estimator and the values actually observed. The RMSD
        represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between
        predicted values and observed values.

        * Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Is a measure of difference between two
        continuous variables. Assume X and Y are variables of paired observations
        that express the same phenomenon. Is a quantity used to measure how close
        forecasts or predictions are to the eventual outcomes.

        * Coefficient of Determination (R2): Iis the proportion of the variance in
        the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

        * Explained Variance: Measures the proportion to which a mathematical model
        accounts for the variation (dispersion) of a given data set.
