# kNN

K-Nearest Neighbor is a algorithm that can be used to solve classification problems. kNN computes from a simple majority vote of the K nearest neighbors of each point present in the training set. The choice of the parameter K is very crucial in this algorithm, and depends on the dataset.



# Use Case:

 - Number of workers/partitions: 8 workers / 32 fragments
 - Data length: 100kk rows of 2-dimension where, 10% is used as training data and 90% to test the fitted model (generated by split operation)
 - Parameters: k=1
 - Time to run: 602 seconds
