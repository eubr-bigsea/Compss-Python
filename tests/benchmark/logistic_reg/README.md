# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function. It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). This implementation uses a Stochastic Gradient Ascent (a variant of the Stochastic gradient descent). It is called stochastic because the derivative based on a randomly chosen single example is a random approximation to the true derivative based on all the training data.


# Use Case:

 - Number of workers/partitions: 8 workers / 32 fragments
 - Data length: 100kk rows of 2-dimension where, 10% is used as training data and 90% to test the fitted model (generated by split operation)
 - Parameters: max_iters=20
 - Time to run: 475 seconds
