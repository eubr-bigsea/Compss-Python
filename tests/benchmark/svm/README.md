# SVM

Support vector machines (SVM) is a supervised learning model used for
binary classification. Given a set of training examples, each marked as
belonging to one or the other of two categories, a SVM training algorithm
builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other,
making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped
so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap
that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same
space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap
they fall. This algorithm is effective in high dimensional spaces and it
is still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than
the number of samples.

The algorithm reads a dataset composed by labels (-1 or 1) and
features (numeric fields).


# Use Case:

 - Number of workers/partitions: 8 workers / 32 fragments
 - Data length: 100kk rows of 2-dimension where, 10% is used as training data and 90% to test the fitted model (generated by split operation)
 - Parameters: max_iters=20, coef_lr=0.1
 - Time to run: 1731 seconds
